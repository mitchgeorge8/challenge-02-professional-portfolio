# Challenge 02 - Professional Portfolio

This challenge activity is called Professional Portfolio. I will be creating my first online portfolio following the guidelines below.

## Description

The challenge for this week, Module 2, is to build my first professional portfolio and deploy it online. I will be creating an interactive web page using the html and css skills that I have learned so far. This portfolio will be a 'live document' of sorts, as I will be updating it with real work as I progress throughout the course.

### User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
